# ParaPanel (v0.0.1) ~ the Pretty Powerfully Parametric Printable Panel!
ParaPanel is an OpenSCAD, open source template for 3D printed or CNCed Eurorack panels. The primary goal of the project is to make panel design as frictionless as possible. 

## TODO
* Make The pannel into a module
* Add bounds checking on HP scaling
* Ensure mounting screws are in scale as the HP is changed
* Add version number to the model
* Add the date to the model (automate?)
* Add a hexagonal grid pattern to the back of the panel
* Make the pannel holes into their own module
